I'm spending this week in Quepos, a small town near the popular Manuel Antonio national park.
It's touristy, but endearingly so.
I spent the last two days exploring the beaches and the park.
Now I'm nursing a nasty sunburn, so I'll spend most of the next few days in the shade.

The [hostel I'm staying at](http://www.widemouthfrog.org/) is pretty luxurious by my standards.
Free coffee, good wifi, comfy benches, and plentiful outlets make for a productive Will.
Time to catch up on writing, coding, and reading before I make my next move.

I booked a flight from Panama City to Medellín, Colombia early next month.
I'll be taking Spanish classes there for at least four weeks.
Between Medellín's comeback story, it's unique topography, it's booming tech scene, and the way it charms all who pass through, it sounds like a Colombian Pittsburgh, except much bigger and with better weather.
So naturally I'm excited!

Anyways, on to pictures!

The first beach I saw. It's been so long since I felt sand between my toes.

Soon after I entered the park, I saw a sloth! And it was moving! Seeing a sloth was one of my top goals in Costa Rica, so now I can happily wander south to Panama.

So many monkeys!

My Dutch friend Jimmy took a picture of me in front of Punta Catedral.

Is the Midwest exotic here?
