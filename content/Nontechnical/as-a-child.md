I made it!

I'm writing from the cozy Hostel Casa del Parque in San Jose, Costa Rica.
It's filled with the sort of characters you'd expect to see in a Central American backpackers hostel:
some Brits watching the UK election results, a German hydrologist learning to salsa, a Dutch entrepreneur.

The city overwhelmed me at first.
I was walking through a park yesterday when I realized - I don't know how to say tree! (El árbol)
I don't even know what to call this day of the week! (miércoles)

Everything is new and I barely know how to buy groceries or cross the street.
But that's one of the best parts of traveling.
You see the world with a child's eyes.
Successfully asking a stranger for directions can be a massive victory.

And the best part of being a child again is that when everything is new, you learn so much so quickly.
While my Spanish is utterly atrocious, I know a great deal more than I did two days ago.
I wander the streets and pick up phrases from street signs and passers-by.
And I can kinda conjugate _several_ verbs.
Watch out world.
