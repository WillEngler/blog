>What dost thou think then of seeing the world? Can't ye see the world where you stand?
>> <cite>Herman Melville</cite>


This time next week, I will be in San Jose, Costa Rica. 
I do not know where I will be staying (probably some hostel). 
I do not know  where I am going next (probably Peru, but who knows).
I do not know when I will return to the states (probably by the end of 2015).

I don't think this is odd, but many do. 
I was under the impression that extended travel was standard for "gap years," those lucky times when someone has few obligations and the means to pick up and go.
I think waht people find odd or concerning is how I am doing it.
I do not have a set itinerary. 
I have no traveling partners (for now!). 
Nor am I affiliated with some university that will give me credits to affirm that I have learned something while traveling.

### Library Cards Are Dangerous

This is how I prefer to travel, and looking back I got a lot of my notions from [_Vagabonding_](http://www.vagabonding.net/book/), a nice little book.
I picked it up from the Cleveland Heights public library while I was feeling wanderlustful on co-op last year.
It is a concise manual on how to embrace uncertainty on the open road.
As Potts puts it,

>Vagabonding is an attitude - a friendly interest in people, places, and things that makes a person an explorer in the truest, most vivid sense of the word.

The book gives practical advice not on how to plan a trip, but how to enter the vagabonding mindset.
Live simply and work hard to finance your journeys.
Travel light and keep an open mind.
Develop a good sense of humor for when you inevitably make a fool of yourself as the culturally ignorant ass that you are.

So it was last year that I determined I would go vagabonding after graduation.
I've saved up dough from my brief stint as a professional software engineer and I have nothing holding me down.

I picked the book up again from Pittsburgh's Carnegie Library (I will miss this library dearly!) and am leafing through it once more.
The advice is timeless and I recommend the book if you want to get in the right mindset for long periods of travel.
