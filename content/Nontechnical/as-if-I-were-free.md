It's 5 AM and I'm wrapping up an overnight layover in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida - my last stop before San Jose.
Sleeping at airports is not as glamorous as they make it out in the movies.

On the bus to the Pittsburgh airport, my dear friend Jess called me to wish me well.
She said she was excited about me "finding myself."
That took me aback.
Maybe people travel to do that, but it isn't my goal.
I feel I've done enough self-finding the last two years of college.

Then what is my goal for this trip?
Do I need one?
I didn't have a well-formed goal when I planned this trip, just a fuzzy lust for adventure.
Still, thinking on Jess's call, writing goals for myself could help me make decisions on the road without hemming me in.

So here are my tentative goals:

* To learn: I want to find out what other parts of the world look and smell like.
I want to find out how people there live.

* To remind myself that I'm free: I have the means and the wits to travel.
I know people who have the same blessings but say "I could never do that."
When I look back on this trip when I'm older, I hope it will remind me not to place constraints on myself.
